# Overview

With the latest version of Guidewire Studio/InsuranceSuite, the overall experience is reliable whereas earlier versions exhibit a few anomalies.

Here are a few additional notes:

- Under macOS Catalina, be aware of improved security restrictions, which may affect starting Guidewire Studio and other tasks. There may be a need to approve Java library execution multiple times during initial Studio startup. See Apple tech note, "[Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)."
- In order to test Windows browsers locally, virtual machines such as [Parallels Desktop for Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) or [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) are great options that perform well.

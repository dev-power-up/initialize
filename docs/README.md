# Overview
> Dev Power-Up! Initialize is a guide on setting up Guidewire Software applications fast!

### General Steps

Although there are only a handful of steps to get up and running, this guide offers additional tips. Here are the basics: 

- Install the Java JDK.
- Unzip the Guidewire Software application.
- Configure the database (optional).
- Install [Dev Power-Up! Launcher](https://github.com/dev-power-up/launcher) (optional).

### What is Dev Power-Up! Launcher?

Dev Power-Up! Launcher is useful with:

- **Multiple environments**. Oftentimes a local sandbox environment is beneficial for review and inspection alongside the configured environment.
- **Multiple application versions**. Different application versions may require different Java JDKs, such as the case where ClaimCenter 8.0.5 is in production and PolicyCenter 10.0.2 is in active development.
- **Multiple workspaces**. It is common practice to use a second, separate cloned configured environment to test concepts.

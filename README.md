## Related Tool

[Dev Power-Up! Launcher](https://dev-power-up.github.io/launcher/) is useful with:

- **Multiple environments**. Oftentimes a local sandbox environment is beneficial for review and inspection alongside the configured environment.
- **Multiple application versions**. Different application versions may require different Java JDKs, such as the case where ClaimCenter 8.0.5 is in production and PolicyCenter 10.0.2 is in active development.
- **Multiple workspaces**. It is common practice to use a second, separate cloned configured environment to test concepts.

## About Dev Power-Up!

Dev Power-Up! is a set of tools developers use with Guidewire Software implementations.

## History & Inception

I am an advocate of both the macOS and productivity improvement and I was excited to run all Guidewire centers on my MacBook as an employee of Guidewire Software in 2006. Although performance and the user interface were dodgy back then, I wrote several shell scripts to enhance my workflow.

I crafted the initial iteration of toolsÂ for macOS, but transformed the same set of scripts for Windows parity. These tools simplify my daily work and I hope it helps simplifies yours.

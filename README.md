[QuickCenter Launcher](https://quickcenter.github.io/launcher/) is useful with:

- **Multiple environments**. Oftentimes a local sandbox environment is beneficial for review and inspection alongside the configured environment.
- **Multiple application versions**. Different application versions may require different Java JDKs, such as the case where ClaimCenter 8.0.5 is in production and PolicyCenter 10.0.2 is in active development.
- **Multiple workspaces**. It is common practice to use a second, separate cloned configured environment to test concepts.
